# YOLOv5_Based_Traffic_Light_System
This repository contains several scripts that leverage a local instance of YOLOv5 to implement a straightforward traffic light system. To use it, download and install a local instance of YOLOv5 following the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). After setting up YOLOv5, paste the downloaded "semaforo" file in the project. You can modify the parameters as needed, this is just a basic framework. 
The "detected" image during execution is defined by the webcam (use software to input a traffic video into your webcam). If everything is set up correctly, the "semaforo.py" script will trigger all other scripts, continuously adapting decisions based on events in your virtual camera.
